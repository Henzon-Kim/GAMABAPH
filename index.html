                <h1>Gawad sa Manlilikha ng Bayan    </h1>
                <p>
                    The Gawad sa Manlilikha ng Bayan, also referred to as GAMABA, originates 
                    from the 1988 National Folk Artists Award organized by the Rotary Club 
                    of Makati-Ayala. These folk and traditional artists, collectively, represent 
                    the rich tapestry of our cultural heritage, transcending their origins to 
                    become integral to our national identity. As Filipinos, they showcase ancient 
                    customs, crafts, and ways of life, fostering an appreciation for our cultural 
                    essence. Through their work, they offer us a reflection of ourselves and our 
                    country, a vision we aspire to embody fully. Envisioned under R.A. 7355, a 
                    "Manlilikha ng Bayan" is defined as a citizen who practices a uniquely Filipino 
                    traditional art, possessing exceptional technical and artistic mastery that has 
                    been passed down and widely embraced by their community with the same level of 
                    proficiency.

                    <font class="name">Alonzo Saclag,</font> a native of Lubuagan, Kalinga, is celebrated as a master of Kalingan performing arts, having learned solely out of his deep fascination for his culture. His mission revolves around preserving and promoting Kalingan traditions, which he achieves through community work and creative expressions like music, dance, ritualistic performance, and architecture. At a young age, he mastered instruments such as tongali (flute) and gangsa (gong). Recognized as a GAMABA awardee in 2000, Saclag's influence extends beyond his performances. He champions education, advocating for Kalinga culture in local schools and establishing the Kalinga Budong Dance Troupe. Notably, he leads efforts to preserve Kalinga heritage, converting an old capitol into a museum and establishing the Awichon Cultural Village, recognized by the NCCA as a focal point of Kalinga culture. (Dela Paz, 2019.; Saclag, 2017).

                    In Barangay Parang, Jolo, Sulu province, women weavers diligently create the pis syabit, a traditional cloth tapestry worn by the Tausug people. Among them is <font class="name">Darhata Sawabi,</font> whose mastery of this art sustains her livelihood and independence. Despite facing challenges like the intricate weaving process and the disruption caused by conflict, Sawabi perseveres, preserving Tausug designs and passing on her knowledge to future generations. Her dedication ensures the continuity of this cultural tradition, while also empowering women in her community to earn a living through weaving. Because of her contributions in championing the Tausug artistry, she was given the Gamaba award in the year 2004 (Tobias, 2019).

                    The Mangyan literary tradition stands out for its use of the ambahan, a poetic form with seven-syllable lines conveying messages through metaphors. <font class="name">Ginaw Bilog,</font> a Hanunoo Mangyan from Mindoro, is deeply immersed in this cultural heritage. He preserves ambahan poetry recorded on bamboo tubes and notebooks, passed down through generations using the pre-colonial script, Surat Mangyan. Ginaw shares these treasures with his community, promoting the roots of his culture at every opportunity. His dedication ensures that the ambahan poetry and other traditional art forms of the Mangyan people thrive, preserving a heritage nearly lost to colonial rule. Ginaw Bilog is celebrated for his efforts in preserving and promoting the elegant art of surat Mangyan and the ambahan. He was awarded the GAMABA title in the year 2003 (De Leon, 2019).

                    <font class="name">Masino Intaray,</font> The Palawan people are the main indigenous groups in southern Palawan, along with the Batak and Tagbanwa. They have a sophisticated and diverse culture that is firmly based on spirituality and peace with the natural world. Their complex ceremonies, such as tambilaw and tinapay, place more emphasis on group sharing than on private property. In community life, music—especially that of the basic ensemble—is essential because it uses interlocking rhythms and harmonies to symbolize harmony and cooperation. Their close relationship with nature and poetic expression is further demonstrated by traditional arts like bagit and kulilal. Masino, a revered character from the Makagwa valley, is a prime example of proficiency in these customs; by his skill as a musician and storyteller, he acts as a protector of Palawan cultural legacy (De Leon, 2019).

                    One of the largest Islamic Filipinos, the Magindanaons are talented in many artistic and musical genres. Situated primarily in particular communities within the province of Magindanao, they exhibit intricate skills in weaving, okir designs, and musical instruments such as the kulintang and kutyapi. However, proficiency in these skills is dwindling among newer generations of the tribe. This is evident, particularly with the two-stringed plucked lute known as the kutyapi. Conversely, the honorable <font class="name">Samaon Sulaiman</font> serves as a beacon of indigenous culture as he is a master of kutyapi who has influenced people in his community with his exceptional playing and mentoring of this instrument. Samaon receives respect and appreciation for his commitment to conserving the kutyapi's melody despite his dual roles as an Imam and barber. Because of his contributions to the renewal of this dying culture, he was awarded the GAMABA recognition in the year 2011.

His talent blossomed as he mastered various instruments like the gabbang, agung, kwintangan kayu, and tuntungan before turning 20. In recognition of his contributions to enriching Yakan culture, he was awarded the GAMABA medal in 2000. Despite his failing eyesight, Ahadas remained focused on passing his knowledge to the next generation, teaching his children Yakan music from a young age. Darna, his daughter, is currently carrying on his heritage by instructing others in Yakan customs. Because he often introduced other Basilan communities to Yakan culture, Ahadas's influence went beyond Lamitan. Ahadas's lectures and annotations were recorded by his younger brother Rohas to guarantee the passing on of his knowledge (Bangsamoro Commission for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage - BARMM, 2022; Maranan, 2011).

Recognized as a master weaver, she earned the endearing nickname "Princess" from her community, reflecting her esteemed position. Her serene demeanor and precise craftsmanship embody the essence of mat weaving, deeply rooted in Blaan heritage. Upper Lasang, her village, provides an ideal environment for the continuation of this tradition, supported by abundant plant materials and a strong cultural identity.

The process involves harvesting, stripping, dyeing, and weaving pandan leaves into intricate designs. Aside from her mastery of their cultural craft, Haja Amina is also known for his more innovative and modern approach as she is open into using commercial dyes, creating her own color tints. While firmly rooted in the traditional customs of her tribe, she adeptly integrates contemporary designs, maintaining a focus on precision and instinct in crafting symmetrical patterns reminiscent of her cultural techniques. Her dedication to the craft has inspired her female descendants to continue the tradition, ensuring that mat weaving remains a thriving art form in her community (Bangsamoro Commission for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage - BARMM, 2022).
